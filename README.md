# Math Equation Solver

## Project Overview
The Math Equation Solver is a web application that allows users to enter mathematical equations, solve them, and visualize the results through charts. Built with modern web technologies, it provides a user-friendly interface for solving both simple and complex equations while offering functionalities for graphical representation of equations.

## Installation
To run the Math Equation Solver locally, simply clone the repository and open the `index.html` file in your web browser. You don't need any special software or packages, as all dependencies are managed via CDN links within the HTML files.

### Steps to Install
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd <project-directory>
   ```
3. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.

## Usage
1. Enter a mathematical equation in the input field. For example: `2 * x + 3 = 7`.
2. Click the "Solve Equation" button to compute the result.
3. If successful, the solution will be displayed below the input field.
4. To visualize the equation, click the "View Chart" button to navigate to the chart page.
5. You can return to the solver by clicking the "Back to Solver" button on the chart page.

## Features
- **Equation Solver**: Solve mathematical equations involving variables.
- **Chart Visualization**: View a chart representation of the entered equation.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages for invalid inputs.

## Dependencies
The project utilizes the following dependencies, included via CDN in the HTML files:
- [Math.js](https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjs/10.6.4/math.min.js): A library for mathematics and expression evaluation.
